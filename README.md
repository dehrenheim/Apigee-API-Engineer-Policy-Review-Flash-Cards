# Apigee-API-Engineer-Policy-Review-Flash-Cards
Flash cards to help review for the Apigee Certified API Engineer exam

To use these flash cards:
1) either download the zip file from this repo or clone the repo
2) open the index.html file with a browser (I used Chrome)
3) please note the StatisticsCollector policy is the last card in the set

I'm open to suggestions for improving these but please note that I'm new to react.js and not a graphic designer. :)

**Please note: this is based upon the nice work of Matthew Greenberg https://codepen.io/mattgreenberg/pen/ggOpOr **
