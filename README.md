# Apigee-API-Engineer-Policy-Review-Flash-Cards
Flash cards to help review for the Apigee Certified API Engineer exam

To use these flash cards:
1) either download the zip file from this repo or clone the repo
2) open the index.html file with a browser (I used Chrome)
3) please note the StatisticsCollector policy is the last card in the set

I'm open to suggestions for improving these but please note that I'm new to react.js and not a graphic designer. :)

**Please note: the flash cards are originally from the nice work of Matthew Greenberg** https://codepen.io/mattgreenberg/pen/ggOpOr  I only updated a few things and added Apigee content from https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/reference-overview-policy
